Additional Features
-------------------

The previous sections describes only the basic core set of ``lib_xua`` details on enabling additional features e.g. S/PDIF are discussed in this section.

Where something must be defined, it is recommended this is done in `xua_conf.h` but could also be done in the application Makefile.

For each feature steps are listed for if calling ``lib_xua`` functions manually - if using the "codeless" programming model then these steps are informational only. 
Each section also includes a sub-section on enabling the feature using the "codeless" model.

For full details of all options please see the API section
