Advanced Usage
**************

Whilst it is possible to program USB Audio devices using ``lib_xua`` by only setting defines 
(see :ref:`sec_basic_usage_codeless`) some developers may want to code a USB Audio device from
scratch using the building blocks provided by `lib_xua`.

This could be for a number of reasons, adding complex DSP, merging with some other functionality
etc. This section describes these building blocks and their use.

Reviewing application note AN00246 is highly recommended at this point.
