Additional Features
*******************

The previous chapter describes the use of core functionality contained within ``lib_xua``
This seciton details enabling additional features with supported external dependencies, for example, 
``lib_xua`` can provide S/PDIF output though the used of ``lib_spdif``

Where something must be defined, it is recommended this is done in `xua_conf.h` but could also be done in the application Makefile.
