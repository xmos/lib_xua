Features & Options
------------------

The previous sections describes only the basic core set of ``lib_xua`` details on enabling additional features e.g. S/PDIF are discussed in this section.

Where something must be defined, it is recommened this is done in `xua_conf.h` but could also be done in the application Makefile.

For each feature steps are listed for if calling ``lib_xua`` functions manually - if using the "codeless" programming model then these steps are informational only. 
Each section also includes a sub-section on enabling the feature using the "codeless" model.

For full details of all options please see the API section

I2S/TDM
~~~~~~~

I2S/TDM is typically fundamental to most products and is built into the ``XUA_AudioHub()`` core.

In order to enable I2S on must declare an array of ports for the data-lines (one for each direction)::

    /* Port declarations. Note, the defines come from the XN file */
    buffered out port:32 p_i2s_dac[] = {PORT_I2S_DAC0}; /* I2S Data-line(s) */
    buffered in port:32 p_i2s_adc[]  = {PORT_I2S_ADC0}; /* I2S Data-line(s) */

Ports for the sample and bit clocks are also required::

    buffered out port:32 p_lrclk        = PORT_I2S_LRCLK; /* I2S Bit-clock */
    buffered out port:32 p_bclk         = PORT_I2S_BCLK;  /* I2S L/R-clock */

.. note::

    All of these ports must be buffered, width 32. Based on whether the xCORE is bus slave/master the ports must be declared as input/output respectively

These ports must then be passed to the ``XUA_AudioHub()`` task appropriately.

I2S functionality also requires two clock-blocks, one for bit and sample clock e.g.::

    /* Clock-block declarations */
    clock clk_audio_bclk = on tile[0]: XS1_CLKBLK_4; /* Bit clock */
    clock clk_audio_mclk = on tile[0]: XS1_CLKBLK_5; /* Master clock */

These hardware resources must be passed into the call to ``XUA_AudioHub()``::

    /* AudioHub/IO core does most of the audio IO i.e. I2S (also serves 
     * as a hub for all audio) */

    on tile[0]: XUA_AudioHub(c_aud, clk_audio_mclk, clk_audio_bclk, p_mclk_in, 
        p_lrclk, p_bclk, p_i2s_dac, p_i2s_adc);


Codeless Programming Model
..........................

All ports and hardware resources are already fully declared, one must simply set the following:

    * `I2S_CHANS_DAC` must be set to the desired number of output channels via I2S
    * `I2S_CHANS_ADC` must be set to the desired number of input channels via I2S
    * `AUDIO_IO_TILE` must be set to the tile where the physical I2S connections reside 
    
For configuration options, master vs slave, TDM etc please see the API section.

S/PDIF Transmit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``lib_xua`` supports the development of devices with S/PDIF transmit functionality through the use of 
``lib_spdif``. The XMOS S/PDIF transmitter runs in a single core and supports rates up to 192kHz.

The S/PDIF transmitter core takes PCM audio samples via a channel and outputs them in S/PDIF format to a port.
Samples are provided to the S/PDIF transmitter task from the ``XUA_AudioHub()`` task.

The channel should be declared a normal::

    chan c_spdif_tx


In order to use the S/PDIF transmmiter with ``lib_xua`` hardware resources must be declared e.g::

    buffered out port:32 p_spdif_tx = PORT_SPDIF_OUT;     /* SPDIF transmit port */

This port should be clocked from the master-clock, ``lib_spdif`` provides a helper function for setting up the port::

    spdif_tx_port_config(p_spdif_tx2, clk_audio_mclk, p_mclk_in, delay);

.. note:: If sharing the master-clock port and clockblock with ``XUA_AudioHub()`` (or any other task) then this setup
          should be done before running the tasks in a ``par`` statement.

Finally the S/PDIF transmitter task must be run - passing in the port and channel for communication with ``XUA_AudioHub``.
For example::

    par
    {
        while(1)
        {
            /* Run the S/PDIF transmitter task */
            spdif_tx(p_spdif_tx2, c_spdif_tx);   
        }
    
        /* AudioHub/IO core does most of the audio IO i.e. I2S (also serves as 
         * a hub for all audio).
         * Note, since we are not using I2S we pass in null for LR and Bit 
         * clock ports and the I2S dataline ports */
        XUA_AudioHub(c_aud, clk_audio_mclk, null, p_mclk_in, null, null, 
            null, null, c_spdif_tx);
    }

For further details please see the documentation, application notes and examples provided for ``lib_spdif``.

Codeless Programming Model
..........................

If using the codeless programming method one must simply ensure the following:

    * `PORT_SPDIF_OUT` is correctly defined in the XN file
    * `XUA_SPDIF_TX_EN` should be defined as non-zero
    * `SPDIF_TX_TILE` is correctly defined (note, this defaults to `AUDIO_IO_TILE`)

For further configuration options please see the API section.
