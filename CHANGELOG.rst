    - CHANGED:    module_queue no longer uses any assert module/lib

6.13.0
------
    - ADDED:      Device now uses implicit feedback when input stream is available (previously explicit
                  feedback pipe always used). This saves chanend/EP resources and means less processing
                  burden for the host. Previous behaviour available by enabling UAC_FORCE_FEEDBACK_EP
    - FIXED:   Exception when SPDIF_TX and ADAT_TX both enabled due to clock-block being configured

                  rather than ignoring most recent samples. Removes any chance of stale input packets
                  being sent to host
    - CHANGED:    module_queue (in sc_usb_audio) now uses lib_xassert rather than module_xassert

6.12.6

    - FIXED:   (Normal) Audio buffering request system modified such that the mixer output is
                  not silent when in underflow case (i.e. host output stream not active) This issue was

------
    - ADDED:      Basic TDM I2S functionality added. See I2S_CHANS_PER_FRAME and I2S_MODE_TDM

6.9.0
-----
    - ADDED:      ADAT S-MUX II functionality (i.e. 2 channels at 192kHz) - Previously only S-MUX
                  supported (4 channels at 96kHz).

                  available USB bus bandwidth.

                  aid timing.
    - CHANGED:    Modifying mix map now only affects specified mix, previous was applied to all
                  mixes. CS_XU_MIXSEL control selector now takes values 0 to MAX_MIX_COUNT + 1
                  (with 0 affecting all mixes).
    - CHANGED:    Channel c_dig_rx is no longer nullable, assists with timing due to removal of
                  null checks inserted by compiler.
    - CHANGED:    ADAT SMUX selection now based on device sample frequency rather than selected
                  stream format - Endpoint 0 now configures clockgen() on a sample-rate change
                  rather than stream start.

6.8.0
-----
    - ADDED:      Evaluation support for iAP EA Native Transport endpoints
    - FIXED:   (Minor) Reverted change in 6.5.1 release where sample rate listing in Audio Class
                  1.0 descriptors was trimmed (previously 4 rates were always reported). This change
                  appears to highlight a Windows (only) enumeration issue with the Input & Output
                  configs
    - FIXED:   (Major) Mixer functionality re-instated, including descriptors and various required
                  updates compatibility with 13 tools
    - FIXED:   (Major) Endpoint 0 was requesting an out of bounds channel whilst requesting level data
    - FIXED:   (Major) Fast mix code not operates correctly in 13 tools, assembler inserting long jmp
                  instructions
    - FIXED:   (Minor) LED level meter code now compatible with 13 tools (shared mem access)
    - FIXED:    (Minor) Ordering of level data from the device now matches channel ordering into
                  mixer (previously the device input data and the stream from host were swapped)
    - CHANGED:    Level meter buffer naming now resemble functionality
