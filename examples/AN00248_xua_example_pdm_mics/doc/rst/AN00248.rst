Overview

Introduction
............

The XMOS USB Audio (XUA) library provides an implemention of USB Audio Class versions 1.0 and 2.0.

This application note demonstrates the implementation of a basic USB Audio Device with 
record functionality from PDM microphones on the xCORE-200 Array Microphone board.

Core PDM microphone functionality is contained in` ``lib_mic_array``. This library includes both the physical
interfacing to the PDM microphones as well as efficient decimation to user selectable output
sample rates - essentially providing PDM to PCM conversion.

To reduce complexity this application note does not enable any other audio interfaces other than recording 
from PDM microphones (i.e. no I2S and the on board DAC is not configured. 

Readers are encouraged to read application note AN00246 in conjunction with this application note.


The Makefile
------------

To start using ``lib_xua``, you need to add ``lib_xua`` to the Makefile. ``lib_mic_array`` should also be 
added for this application example::

  USED_MODULES = .. lib_xua lib_mic_array ...

This demo also uses the XMOS USB Device library (``lib_xud``) for low-level USB connectivity.
The Makefile therefore also includes this lib::

  USED_MODULES = .. lib_xud ..

``lib_xud`` library requires some flags for correct operation. Firstly the 
tile on which ``lib_xud`` will be executed, for example::

    XCC_FLAGS = .. -DUSB_TILE=tile[1] ..

Secondly, the architecture of the target device, for example::

  XCC_FLAGS = .. -DXUD_SERIES_SUPPORT=XUD_X200_SERIES ..

Includes
--------

This application requires the system header files that contains XMOS xCORE specific
defines for declaring and initialising hardware:

.. literalinclude:: app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-on: include <xs1.h>
   :end-before: include "xua.h"

The XUA and XUD library functions are defined in header files ``xua.h`` and ``xud_device.h`` respectively. These headers must
be included in the code in order to use these libraries. 

.. literalinclude:: app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-on: include "xua.h"
   :end-on: include "xud_device.h"

The application uses PDM interfacing and decimation code from ``lib_mic_array``. This header
must be included in the code.

.. literalinclude:: app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-on: /* From lib_mic
   :end-on: include "mic_array.h"

Declarations
------------

Allocating hardware resources for lib_xua
.........................................

A minimal implementation of a USB Audio device using ``lib_xua``,  without I2S functionalilty,
requires the follow I/O pins:

    - Audio Master clock (from clock source to xCORE)

On an xCORE the pins are controlled by ``ports``. The application therefore declares a 
port for the master clock input signal.

.. literalinclude:: app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-on: /* Lib_xua port declaration
   :end-on: in port p_mclk_in

``lib_xua`` also requires two ports for internally calculating USB feedback. Please refer to 
the ``lib_xua`` library documentation for further details.  In this example ``XUA_Buffer()`` and ``XUA_AudioHub()``
reside on the same tile and can therefore make use of the same master-clock port.

These ports are declared as follows:

.. literalinclude:: app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-on: /* Resources for USB feedback
   :end-on: in port p_for

In addition to ``port`` resources a single clock-block resource is also required:

.. literalinclude:: app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-on: /* Clock-block declarations
   :end-on: clock clk_audio_mclk

Again, for the same reasoning as the master-clock ports, only one master-clock clock-blocks is required.


Allocating hardware resources for lib_mic_array
...............................................

The S/PDIF transmitter requires a single (buffered) 1-bit port:

.. literalinclude:: app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-on: /* Lib_spdif port 
   :end-on: buffered out port 

This port must be clocked from the audio master clock. This application note chooses to declare
an extra clock-block as follows:

.. literalinclude:: app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-on: clock clk_spdif_tx
   :end-before: /* Lib_xua


Other declarations
..................

``lib_xua`` currently requires the manual declaration of tables for the endpoint types for
``lib_xud`` and the calling the main XUD function in a par (``XUD_Main()``).

For a simple application the following endpoints are required:

    - ``Control`` enpoint zero 
    - ``Isochonous`` endpoint for each direction for audio data to/from the USB host

These are declared as follows:

.. literalinclude:: app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-on: /* Endpoint type tables
   :end-on: XUD_EpType epTypeTableIn

Configuring lib_xua
-------------------

S/PDIF Tx functionality must be  ``lib_xua`` 

``lib_xua`` has many parameters than can be configured at build time, some examples include:

    - Sample-rates
    - Channel counts
    - Audio Class version
    - Product/Vendor ID's
    - Various product strings
    - Master clock frequency

To enable S/PDIF funtionality ``XUA_SPDIF_TX_EN`` must be set to a non-zero value.

These parameters are set via defines in an optional ``xua_conf.h`` header file. For this simple application the 
complete contents of this file are as follows:

.. literalinclude:: xua_conf.h
   :start-on: // Copyright
   :end-on: #endif

The application main() function
-------------------------------

The ``main()`` function sets up the tasks in the application.

Various channels are required in order to allow the required tasks to communcate. 
These must first be declared:

.. literalinclude:: app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-on: /* Channels for lib_xud
   :end-on: chan c_spdif_tx

The rest of the ``main()`` function starts all of the tasks in parallel
using the xC ``par`` construct:

.. literalinclude:: app_xua_simple.xc
   :start-on: par
   :end-before: return 0

This code starts the low-level USB task, an Endpoint 0 task, an Audio buffering task and a task to handle 
the audio I/O. Note, since there is no I2S funcitonality in this example this task simply forwards samples to the 
SPDIF transmitter task. In addition the ``spdif_tx()`` task is also run.

Note that the ``spdif_tx_port_config()`` function is called before a nested ``par`` of ``spdif_tx()`` and ``XUA_AudioHub()``.
This is because of the "shared" nature of ``p_mclk_in`` and avoids a parrallel usage check failure by the XMOS toolchain.

Demo Hardware Setup
-------------------

To run the demo, connect a USB cable to power the xCORE-200 MC Audio board 
and plug the xTAG to the board and connect the xTAG USB cable to your
development machine.

Launching the demo application
------------------------------

Once the demo example has been built either from the command line using xmake or
via the build mechanism of xTIMEcomposer studio it can be executed on the xCORE-200
MC Audio board.

Once built there will be a ``bin/`` directory within the project which contains
the binary for the xCORE device. The xCORE binary has a XMOS standard .xe extension.

Launching from the command line
...............................

From the command line you use the ``xrun`` tool to download and run the code
on the xCORE device::

  xrun --xscope bin/app_xua_simple.xe

Once this command has executed the application will be running on the
xCORE-200 MC Audio Board

Launching from xTIMEcomposer Studio
...................................

From xTIMEcomposer Studio use the run mechanism to download code to xCORE device.
Select the xCORE binary from the ``bin/`` directory, right click and go to Run
Configurations. Double click on xCORE application to create a new run configuration,
enable the xSCOPE I/O mode in the dialog box and then
select Run.

Once this command has executed the application will be running on the
xCORE-200 MC Audio board.

Running the application
.......................

Once running the device will be detected as a USB Audio device - note, Windows operating 
systems may require a third party driver for correct operation
